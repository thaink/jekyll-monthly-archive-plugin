## Jekyll monthly archive plugin for minimal-mistake theme

Minimal-mistakes is a very nice theme. I love it a lot.  
Check it out at https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/  
  

This plugin is forked from Shigeya with some modifications:
- I updated deprecation function to latest one. It is now working with jekyll 3.8.3
- I modify the layout file to be compatible with minimal-mistakes theme. You can use it right away.

Check out Shigeya's readme file for instruction.
